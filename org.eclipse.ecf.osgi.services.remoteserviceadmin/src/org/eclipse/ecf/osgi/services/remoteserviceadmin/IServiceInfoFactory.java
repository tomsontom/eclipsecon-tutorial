 * Service info factory service contract. A service info factory is used by the

 * to {@link IServiceInfo} instances (via
 * {@link #createServiceInfo(IDiscoveryAdvertiser, EndpointDescription)}. The
 * resulting IServiceInfo instances are then used to by the
 * {@link EndpointDescriptionAdvertiser} to publish the EndpointDescription
 * metadata to a {@link IDiscoveryAdvertiser}.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * If no other instances of this service have been registered, a default
 * instance of {@link ServiceInfoFactory} will be used by the
 * {@link EndpointDescriptionAdvertiser}. Note that this default instance is
 * registered with the lowest possible priority, so that if other
 * {@link IServiceInfoFactory} instances are registered, they will be
 * preferred/used over the default. This means that Those wishing to
 * customize/control this process of converting {@link EndpointDescription}s to
 * {@link IServiceInfo} must
 * <ul>
 * <li>create their own implementation of {@link IServiceInfoFactory}</li>
 * <li>register it with the OSGi service registry with a priority
 * ({org.osgi.framework.Constants#SERVICE_RANKING}) higher than
 * {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE}</li>
 * <ul>
 * Then at runtime, when needed by the {@link EndpointDescriptionAdvertiser},
 * the new service info factory will be used.
